Requirements:
- Windows system with Internet connection without troublesome proxy
- Visual Studio
- Azure PowerShell

How to build and run:
- In Windows PowerShell ISE, run the scripts in the Scripts directory.
  Watch for any errors.

*** TODO ***

High:

- Add more background information to instructions

Medium:

- Improve very slow "conversation simulator". I tried parallelizing execution
  but that resulted in Server errors (throttling?)

Low:

- Automate Azure Function creation
- Automate Logic App creation

*** NOTES ***
